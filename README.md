## What's go-MEL?

MEL parser in golang.  
This program receives a text file and generates AST (abstract syntax tree).  
This program does not evaluate MEL. It just creates an AST.


## What's MEL?

    The Maya Embedded Language (MEL) is a scripting language used to simplify tasks in Autodesk's 3D Graphics Software Maya.
    Most tasks that can be achieved through Maya's GUI can be achieved with MEL, as well as certain tasks 
    that are not available from the GUI. MEL offers a method of speeding up complicated or repetitive tasks,
    as well as allowing users to redistribute a specific set of commands to others that may find it useful.

## Appreciation

This program was made with reference to the book "Go言語でつくるインタプリタ".  
Without the book, go-MEL would not have existed.  
I cannot thank the book author enough. I'd say the author really help for Inspiration.
